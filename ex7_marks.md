# Concurrency code (0-5). 
- [ ] 5 - novel solution that demonstrates breadth of analysis. Applies novel or in depth concurrency features.
- [ ] 4 - expected solution, well put together. Shows understanding of concurrency concepts in java. 
- [ ] 3 - missing some key components or lacks depth. Submission hard to understand or find code for. No explanation of the changes or chosen approach. Code not commented or below expectations.
- [ ] 2 - 3, but even poorer.
- [ ] 1 - little evidence of design; mostly missing components.
- [ ] 0 - not handed in or not available.

# Concurrency writeup (0-5).

- [ ] 5 - 4, with evidence on in-depth analysis, including code examples or highlights. Focuses on lesser-known distinctions or identifies new tradeoffs. 
- [ ] 4 - Good technical writing (well structured, easy to follow, appropriate grammar and spelling). Clearly demonstrates understanding of different approaches. 
- [ ] 3 - A 4, but with gaps in the areas outlined: writing, technical analysis unclear or below standard.
- [ ] 2 - missing many aspects; lacks insight and work. E.g. no insight, writing hard to follow. 
- [ ] 1 - little evidence of work; mostly missing components.
- [ ] 0 - not handed in or not available.  

# Code smells (0-5)
- [ ] 5 - A 4, plus depth of analysis and complexity of refactoring. Highlights the tests that help lend confidence to the changes.
- [ ] 4 - Commits clearly documented. Link and markdown makes it clear what smells exist. Refactoring is documented and easy to understand. Refactoring is appropriate for smell.
- [ ] 3 -  Similar to 4, but missing smells/refactoring, smell and refactoring are not related, or not well motivated. 
- [ ] 2 - Hard to figure out what is happening. Missing many aspects; lacks insight and evidence of work.
- [ ] 1 - Little evidence of work; mostly missing components.
- [ ] 0 - not handed in or not available.
